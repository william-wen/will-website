I'm experienced in full-stack web development and machine learning methodology through various internships, side projects and a reearch position! I love to travel. In fact, my first coop term took place at a start-up in Shanghai called Hikedu Inc. I also like to workout and meet new people! Recently, I picked up voice acting as a hobby so I might link a video to this site later ;)",
